## Two-tailed vs. one-tailed tests

### The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis proposed here correspond to a two-tailed test, which allows you to distinguish between three cases:

* A statistically significant positive result
* A statistically significant negative result
* No statistically significant difference.

Sometimes when people run A/B tests, they will use a one-tailed test, which only allows you to distinguish between two cases:

* A statistically significant positive result
* No statistically significant result

Which one you should use depends on what action you will take based on the results. If you're going to launch the experiment for a statistically significant positive change, and otherwise not, then you don't need to distinguish between a negative result and no result, so a one-tailed test is good enough. If you want to learn the direction of the difference, then a two-tailed test is necessary.
