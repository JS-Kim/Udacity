* Operational definition
1. A way of turning constructs (that have no unit) into variables we can measure
2. A way of describing a variable in terms of the way we can measure it

* Extraneous (or Lurking) variables
1. Provide possible alternative explanations for observed relationships between variables
2. Are factors that could influence the relationships we measure between two or more variables
3. Should be controlled in an experiment before we can make confident causal statements
4. Make it difficult to make causal statements from data from observational studies.

* In an experiment, the researcher manipulates the "independent" variable, measures changes in the "dependent" variable, and seeks to control "lurking(extraneous)" variables.

*Hypotheses are statements about the relationships between variables.

*Observational studies --> finding correlation between variables, but not causation because subject assignments are not controlled by the investigator.
*Experimental studies --> finding correlation and causation by experiments, where each subject is *randomly assigned* to a treated group or a control group.

*With such a small dataset and a weak trend, it's hard to draw conclusions from the data.

*Normal distribution: the mean, median, mode are equal

*Median and mean cannot be used to describe categorical data such as gender or country of origin, but mode can be used to do that.

*Interquartile Range (IQR): Q3 (top 25%) - Q1 (bottom 25%)

* Definition of Outlier: < Q1 - 1.5 * (IQR), > Q3 + 1.5 * (IQR)

* In Excel, short-cut for copy+
: cmd+c (copy a single cell), go to the first data cell, cmd+down-key, go to the last cell where to be pasted, cmd+shift+up-key, and then cmd-v.

* Web-based data ploting / histogram / etc.
