Lesson 8: Estimation

* Standard error is the standard deviation of sampling distribution: how far the sample means are away from the population mean
* In sampling distribution, 95% of sample means fall within 1.96 (z-score) standard errors from the population.
* +- 2.33 (z-score) are the CRITICAL VALUES of Z for 98% confidence
* +- 1.96 (z-score) are the CRITICAL VALUES of Z for 95% confidence

* Margin of Error
-- Y% confidence interval: (sample_mean - Z* (sigma/sqrt(n), sample_mean + Z * (sigma/sqrt(n))
-- margin of error = Z * sigma/sqrt(n), i.e., half the width of the confidence interval
----- compare this with "2 * standard_error = margin of error, i.e., 2 * sigma/sqrt(n)" that was lectured in the earlier lesson.

* 95% CI (confidence interval) for the population mean, when the population's SD is given
: sample_mean +- 1.96 * SD/sqrt(sample_size)
* 98% CI (confidence interval) for the population mean, when the population's SD is given
: sample_mean +- 2.33 * SD/sqrt(sample_size)
