Lesson 8: Estimation

* Standard error is the standard deviation of sampling distribution: how far the sample means are away from the population mean
* 2 * standard_error = margin of error, i.e., 2 * sigma/sqrt(n)
* In sampling distribution, 95% of sample means fall within 1.96 (z-score) standard errors from the population.
* +- 2.33 (z-score) are the CRITICAL VALUES of Z for 98% confidence
* +- 1.96 (z-score) are the CRITICAL VALUES of Z for 95% confidence
